 * @class puremvc.Notifier
 * 
 * A Base Notifier implementation.
 * 
 * {@link puremvc.MacroCommand MacroCommand}, 
 * {@link puremvc.SimpleCommand SimpleCommand}, 
 * {@link puremvc.Mediator Mediator} and 
 * {@link puremvc.Proxy Proxy}
 * all have a need to send Notifications
 * 
 * The Notifier interface provides a common method called #sendNotification that 
 * relieves implementation code of the necessity to actually construct 
 * Notifications.
 * 
 * The Notifier class, which all of the above mentioned classes
 * extend, provides an initialized reference to the 
 * {@link puremvc.Facade Facade}
 * Multiton, which is required for the convienience method
 * for sending Notifications but also eases implementation as these
 * classes have frequent 
 * {@link puremvc.Facade Facade} interactions 
 * and usually require access to the facade anyway.
 * 
 * NOTE: In the MultiCore version of the framework, there is one caveat to
 * notifiers, they cannot send notifications or reach the facade until they
 * have a valid multitonKey. 
 * 
 * The multitonKey is set:
 *   - on a Command when it is executed by the Controller
 *   - on a Mediator is registered with the View
 *   - on a Proxy is registered with the Model. 
 * 
 * @constructor
